# LeetCode Java Solutions

This repository contains **complete Java programs** for selected **LeetCode** problems. The goal is to practice and master **Data Structures and Algorithms** by solving problems regularly using Java.

Each solution is written as a full, standalone Java program with a `main` method. The implementations also include different **conditions**, **edge cases**, and **variations** to strengthen problem-solving skills and improve logical thinking.
